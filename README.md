## 📁 Contents
- `jupyter_notebooks/` – core analysis scripts used for data processing and figure generation  
- `genbank_actinokineospora/` – genbank files for Actinokineospora genera
- `README.md` – current document 

## 🖊️ Note

This repository contains all Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of **codon usage bias**, **rare codon distribution**, and their enrichment in **biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)** across 11 genera of the *Actinomycetota* phylum.  
The primary focus is on the **rare TTA (Leu)** codon, which is known to play a regulatory role in *Streptomyces* and related genera.  
All analyses were also **repeated for the AGA (Arg)** codon using the same pipeline and methodology unless otherwise stated.
